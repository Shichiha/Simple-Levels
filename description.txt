Simple Levels aims to add the levelling system from Castlevania Order of Ecclesia into Terraria with zero care as to how that messes with the vanilla balance.
Commands:
"/simple" to view your current level and some extra info.
"/simpleSetlevel newLevel" to set your level at any time.
Keybinds:
Show Level info: displays the same info as the "/simple" command.
